		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="desc">As early as December (yep) I at last ventured to start my winter coat search. This one being my fifth winter spent in Des Moines, Iowa, which means it’s finally time to nail it. For my first cold season, I had no idea how cold a blizzards-blast this state and the city could actually be. So being low on the cash at the moment, I ended up just wearing everything I owned at once. Unfortunately, that list included piling 3 lighter coats on top of one another. My second winter was much less of a winter (my fellow New Yorkers, people in the city I’ve moved from and who came to visit me, remember the lovely, mild thing that was winter 2011-2012, right? The third time was not a charm, as the weather has gotten so cold that I gave up entirely and bought one of those delightfully warm head to ankle Uniqlo numbers.</p>

Take every label on it into account. While being made out of cheap acrylics, even if it’s from a designer with high price points – simply teach yourself to say no.Also quite often, coats that are advertised as “wool” are only some tiny percent wool, and in reality turn out to be consisting of more than 80% nylon and spandex. Keep in mind, that no polyester will keep you warm in a snow storm, and it also gives your sweat a really funky feet smell. Make sure you’re buying a thing made to last.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="desc">As early as December (yep) I at last ventured to start my winter coat search. This one being my fifth winter spent in Des Moines, Iowa, which means it’s finally time to nail it. For my first cold season, I had no idea how cold a blizzards-blast this state and the city could actually be. So being low on the cash at the moment, I ended up just wearing everything I owned at once. Unfortunately, that list included piling 3 lighter coats on top of one another. My second winter was much less of a winter (my fellow New Yorkers, people in the city I’ve moved from and who came to visit me, remember the lovely, mild thing that was winter 2011-2012, right? The third time was not a charm, as the weather has gotten so cold that I gave up entirely and bought one of those delightfully warm head to ankle Uniqlo numbers.</p>

<h3>Tip #2: Brace yourself to be disappointed</h3>
Take every label on it into account. While being made out of cheap acrylics, even if it’s from a designer with high price points – simply teach yourself to say no.Also quite often, coats that are advertised as “wool” are only some tiny percent wool, and in reality turn out to be consisting of more than 80% nylon and spandex. Keep in mind, that no polyester will keep you warm in a snow storm, and it also gives your sweat a really funky feet smell. Make sure you’re buying a thing made to last.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="desc">As early as December (yep) I at last ventured to start my winter coat search.

<h3>Tip #2: Brace yourself to be disappointed</h3>
Take every label on it into account. While being made out of cheap acrylics, even if it’s from a designer with high price points – simply teach yourself to say no.Also quite often, coats that are advertised as “wool” are only some tiny percent wool, and in reality turn out to be consisting of more than 80% nylon and spandex. Keep in mind, that no polyester will keep you warm in a snow storm, and it also gives your sweat a really funky feet smell. Make sure you’re buying a thing made to last.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="desc">As early as December (yep) I at last ventured to start my winter coat search. This one being my fifth winter spent in Des Moines, Iowa, which means it’s finally time to nail it. For my first cold season, I had no idea how cold a blizzards-blast this state and the city could actually be. So being low on the cash at the moment, I ended up just wearing everything I owned at once. Unfortunately, that list included piling 3 lighter coats on top of one another. My second winter was much less of a winter (my fellow New Yorkers, people in the city I’ve moved from and who came to visit me, remember the lovely, mild thing that was winter 2011-2012, right? The third time was not a charm, as the weather has gotten so cold that I gave up entirely and bought one of those delightfully warm head to ankle Uniqlo numbers.</p>

<h3>Tip #2: Brace yourself to be disappointed</h3>
Take every label on it into account. While being made out of cheap acrylics, even if it’s from a designer with high price points – simply teach yourself to say no.Also quite often, coats that are advertised as “wool” are only some tiny percent wool, and in reality turn out to be consisting of more than 80% nylon and spandex. Keep in mind, that no polyester will keep you warm in a snow storm, and it also gives your sweat a really funky feet smell. Make sure you’re buying a thing made to last.
